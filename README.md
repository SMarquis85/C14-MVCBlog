  ## Description of Assignment

Internet retail, also known as e-commerce, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, having generated an estimated US$29 trillion in 2017 (Source: United Nations Conference on Trade and Development). E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to the prevalence of these platforms, developers should understand the fundamental architecture of e-commerce sites.

Your challenge is to build the back end for an e-commerce site. You’ll take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

  ## Final Work Review

**"Always leave the code a little cleaner than when you found it."**  This action was applied to ALL JAVASCRIPT files. To create this assignment, I used Lawrence Wilson's Audiobook, Cathy Tanimura's book on SQL. References we're found on Google, multiple websites including W3Schools, DEV, GitHub, Insomnia and Tutorialspoint. YouTube was helpful as well as all ZOOM recordings (of previous classes). Looks much cleaner, organised and easier to find what you are looking for. I also received the help of my tutor, Erik Hoversten. He helped me fix the errors I have encountered while deploying to Heroku.
